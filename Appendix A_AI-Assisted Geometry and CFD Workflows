# Appendix A — AI-Assisted Geometry and CFD Workflows

This appendix documents **non-traditional, AI-assisted tools** that may be used to accelerate early-stage CFD workflows. These tools are *explicitly not required* for standard OpenFOAM practice and should never replace validated CAD pipelines in design-critical or regulatory contexts.

The purpose of this appendix is to:

* Clarify *where* AI-generated geometry can be useful
* Define *strict limits* on its engineering validity
* Provide a defensible workflow for concept-level CFD only

---

## A.1 Scope and Intended Use

AI-assisted geometry tools (e.g. image-to-3D systems such as Microsoft Copilot 3D) are suitable only for:

* Conceptual studies
* Educational demonstrations
* Sensitivity analyses where *relative* trends matter more than absolute values

They are **not suitable** for:

* Final design verification
* Regulatory submissions
* Safety-critical assessments
* Any case where dimensional accuracy is required

The reader is expected to understand basic CAD–mesh–solver workflows prior to using this appendix.

## A.2 Copilot 3D: Role in the CFD Workflow

Copilot 3D converts a single image into a triangulated surface model (typically GLB format). From a CFD perspective, this process introduces several implicit assumptions:

* Geometry scale is inferred, not defined
* Small features are hallucinated or smoothed
* Sharp edges and corners are rarely preserved

As a result, Copilot 3D outputs should be treated as **visual proxies**, not engineering geometry.

Acceptable CFD uses include:

* Blockage-ratio studies
* Wake interaction demonstrations
* Mesh and solver training cases

Unacceptable uses include:

* Pressure loss prediction
* Structural load estimation
* Validation against experimental data

---

## A.3 Geometry Conditioning Pipeline (Mandatory)

All AI-generated geometry must pass through a conditioning stage before meshing. A typical pipeline is:

1. **Copilot 3D**

   * Image → GLB
   * Treat output as unscaled and unverified

2. **Blender (or equivalent)**

   * Apply explicit scaling
   * Remove internal faces
   * Ensure watertight (manifold) surfaces
   * Recalculate normals consistently
   * Simplify topology where necessary

3. **Export**

   * STL or OBJ
   * Units explicitly documented

Skipping this conditioning step almost guarantees meshing failure or unphysical results.

## A.4 OpenFOAM Pre-Mesh Quality Gates

Before invoking `snappyHexMesh`, the following checks should be performed:

* Surface is watertight (no holes)
* No self-intersections
* Feature edges resolvable by target cell size
* Minimum radius of curvature ≥ 2–3× local cell size

Recommended utilities and practices:

* `surfaceCheck`
* `surfaceFeatureExtract`
* Visual inspection in ParaView or Blender

Any failure at this stage invalidates downstream results, regardless of solver convergence.

---

## A.5 Meshing and Solver Considerations

AI-generated geometry typically lacks sharp, well-defined features. As a result:

* Boundary layers may be poorly defined
* Separation points may be displaced
* Turbulence results should be interpreted qualitatively

Recommended practices:

* Prefer **robust solvers** (e.g. `pimpleFoam`)
* Use conservative Courant limits
* Avoid over-interpretation of absolute values

---

## A.6 Validation and Documentation Requirements

Any CFD case using AI-generated geometry must explicitly document:

* Geometry source (AI-generated)
* Conditioning steps performed
* Known limitations and excluded physics

This disclosure is essential to avoid false confidence and misuse of results.

---

## A.7 Legal, IP, and Confidentiality Considerations

Users must ensure that:

* Uploaded images do not violate confidentiality agreements
* Generated geometry complies with licensing terms
* AI tools are not used with proprietary or sensitive data

Failure to address these issues can have legal consequences independent of CFD accuracy.

---

## A.8 Summary

AI-assisted geometry tools can accelerate *concept-level* CFD workflows when used with discipline and transparency. They do not reduce the need for engineering judgement; they increase it.

When in doubt, default to conventional CAD and validated workflows.
