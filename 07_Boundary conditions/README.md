# Chapter 7 — Boundary Conditions

Boundary conditions are part of the *physical model*. A numerically stable simulation can still be physically wrong if boundary conditions are inconsistent or over-constrained.

This chapter provides engineering guidance for choosing boundary conditions in OpenFOAM, with emphasis on:
- Physical consistency
- Avoiding over-constraint
- Backflow-safe outlet handling
- Boundary conditions that match turbulence and mesh assumptions
