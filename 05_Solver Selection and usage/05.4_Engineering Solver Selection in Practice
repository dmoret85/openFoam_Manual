# 05.4 Engineering Solver Selection in Practice

While Section 5.1 classified solvers by physics and Sections 5.2–5.3 discussed steady–transient decision-making and algorithmic structure, this section focuses on **how those concepts are applied in real engineering workflows**. The emphasis here is not on solver syntax, but on *matching solver assumptions to the dominant physical mechanisms* and avoiding common but subtle misuse.

In practice, solver selection is rarely binary. Engineers often work within constraints of computational cost, project timelines, and data availability. The purpose of this section is therefore to provide a **reasoned, defensible framework** for solver choice rather than prescriptive rules.

## 5.4.1 Solver Choice as a Physical Modelling Decision

A CFD solver encodes assumptions about:

* Temporal behaviour (steady vs transient)
* Coupling between pressure and velocity
* Treatment of density and phase interfaces
* Numerical stability versus temporal accuracy

From an engineering standpoint, the solver must resolve the **slowest and most energetic physical processes** that influence the quantity of interest. Any solver that suppresses or averages these processes—regardless of residual convergence—produces results of limited physical meaning.

This is why solver selection must precede detailed meshing or turbulence-model tuning. If the solver cannot represent the governing physics, no amount of numerical refinement will recover validity.

## 5.4.2 Incompressible Single-Phase Flows

For constant-density, single-phase flows, solver choice is governed primarily by the *temporal character of the flow*.

* **Steady solvers (`simpleFoam`)** are appropriate only when the flow reaches a statistically stationary state with no dominant unsteadiness (e.g., fully developed pipe flow).
* **Transient solvers (`pisoFoam`)** are required when the instantaneous evolution of the flow field affects the engineering outcome (e.g., pressure surges, vortex shedding).
* **Hybrid solvers (`pimpleFoam`)** occupy the broad middle ground, where transient effects exist but time-averaged quantities are sufficient.

In many industrial and civil engineering problems, `pimpleFoam` represents the safest default, as it preserves transient capability while allowing controlled relaxation toward steady behaviour.

## 5.4.3 Free-Surface and Multiphase Flows

When phase interfaces are present, solver choice is no longer optional. Free-surface dynamics introduce wave propagation, interface deformation, and strong nonlinear coupling between momentum and volume fraction transport.

Solvers such as `interFoam` and `interIsoFoam` explicitly resolve these mechanisms. As a consequence:

* The governing equations are **inherently transient**
* Time-step size is constrained by both Courant and interface compression criteria
* Attempting steady-state formulations is physically invalid

From an engineering perspective, any attempt to force convergence of a free-surface problem using steady-state logic represents a modelling error, not a numerical one.

## 5.4.4 Compressible and Buoyancy-Driven Flows

Compressible solvers extend the incompressible framework by allowing density to vary with pressure, temperature, or composition. These solvers should be selected only when such variations materially influence the engineering question.

Examples include:

* High-speed gas flows
* Strongly buoyant or thermally driven systems
* Problems where acoustic or pressure-wave propagation is relevant

Using compressible solvers without physical justification increases computational cost and often degrades robustness without improving solution fidelity.

## 5.4.5 Common Engineering Misuse Patterns

Several solver-selection errors recur frequently in practice:

* Applying steady-state solvers to flows with intrinsic unsteadiness
* Using incompressible solvers for interface-dominated problems
* Treating solver choice as a numerical convenience rather than a modelling decision
* Attempting to suppress physical oscillations through under-relaxation

These errors are particularly dangerous because they rarely cause solver failure; instead, they produce *plausible but incorrect* results.

## 5.4.6 Position Within the CFD Workflow

Solver selection forms the conceptual bridge between:

* **Problem definition** (Chapter 02)
* **Mesh strategy and resolution** (Chapter 04)
* **Numerical stability and convergence control** (Chapter 08)

A well-chosen solver simplifies all downstream decisions. A poorly chosen solver complicates every stage of the analysis and undermines validation efforts.

This completes the solver-selection framework. The next chapter addresses **turbulence modelling**, where additional layers of physical approximation are introduced and must be aligned with the solver assumptions established here.
