## 5.3 SIMPLE, PISO, and PIMPLE: Conceptual Differences for Engineers

OpenFOAM solvers are built around three primary pressure–velocity coupling algorithms: SIMPLE, PISO, and PIMPLE. While these algorithms are well-documented mathematically elsewhere, engineers primarily need to understand *what problem each algorithm is designed to solve* and *how misuse affects results*.

This section explains the intent and practical implications of each algorithm from an engineering perspective.

### 5.3.1 SIMPLE Algorithm

The SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations) algorithm is designed for **steady-state** problems.

Key characteristics:

* Iterative solution towards a fixed point
* Use of under-relaxation to maintain stability
* No physical time advancement

Engineering interpretation:

> SIMPLE stabilises the solution by slowing convergence, not by resolving transient physics.

Typical use cases:

* Fully developed internal flows
* Long-term mean flow fields
* Problems where transient behaviour is irrelevant to design outcomes

Common misuse:

* Applying SIMPLE to flows with inherent unsteadiness
* Interpreting iteration count as physical time
* Excessive relaxation masking poor mesh or physics choices

If heavy under-relaxation is required for convergence, this often indicates a deeper modelling issue rather than a need for further numerical tuning.

### 5.3.2 PISO Algorithm

The PISO (Pressure-Implicit with Splitting of Operators) algorithm is designed for **transient** simulations.

Key characteristics:

* Multiple pressure corrections per time step
* No reliance on under-relaxation
* Stability governed primarily by time-step size

Engineering interpretation:

> PISO assumes that the time step is small enough to accurately resolve the physics.

Typical use cases:

* Rapid transient events
* Strongly time-dependent flows
* Free-surface or multiphase simulations with strict Courant limits

Common misuse:

* Using overly large time steps to reduce runtime
* Treating PISO as a “more stable” version of SIMPLE
* Ignoring Courant number constraints

When PISO becomes unstable, the cause is almost always excessive time stepping rather than insufficient solver tuning.

### 5.3.3 PIMPLE Algorithm

PIMPLE is a hybrid algorithm combining elements of SIMPLE and PISO. It introduces outer correction loops that allow greater flexibility in time-step size.

Key characteristics:

* Supports transient and pseudo-steady s
