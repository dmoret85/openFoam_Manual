## 5.2 Steady-State vs Transient: Engineering Decision Framework

One of the most common modelling errors in CFD is selecting a steady-state solver for a problem that is fundamentally transient. This choice is often driven by convenience or runtime considerations rather than physics. While OpenFOAM allows many transient problems to be forced into a steady-state formulation, doing so can invalidate the results even if numerical convergence is achieved.

From an engineering perspective, the decision between steady-state and transient simulation must be based on whether *time-dependent behaviour is essential to the design question*.

### 5.2.1 When Steady-State Modelling Is Appropriate

Steady-state solvers are appropriate when:

* The flow is statistically steady over the time scales of interest.
* The engineering objective concerns long-term average behaviour.
* Transient fluctuations do not materially affect design outcomes.

Typical examples include:

* Fully developed internal pipe flow
* Long-term average velocities or head losses
* External flows where only mean forces are required

In these cases, steady-state solvers (e.g. `simpleFoam`) provide:

* Reduced computational cost
* Simpler convergence assessment
* Efficient parametric testing

It is important to recognise that steady-state solvers do **not** represent physical time. Instead, they iteratively converge towards a fixed solution that satisfies the governing equations under the assumed conditions.

### 5.2.2 When Transient Modelling Is Required

Transient modelling is mandatory when:

* Flow features evolve in time and influence design decisions
* Free surfaces move or deform
* Flow separation, reattachment, or vortex shedding is significant
* Loads, forces, or discharges vary meaningfully with time

Examples include:

* Dam breach and overtopping scenarios
* Rapid filling or emptying of basins
* Free-surface flow with wave action
* Highly separated or unsteady external flows

In these cases, using a steady-state solver constitutes a *physical modelling error*, regardless of numerical convergence quality.

### 5.2.3 Pseudo-Steady and Averaged Transient Solutions

In practice, some problems sit between purely steady and fully transient regimes. A common and defensible approach is to:

1. Run a transient simulation using an appropriate solver.
2. Allow initial transients to decay.
3. Extract time-averaged quantities over a representative window.

This approach captures unsteady physics while still producing steady engineering metrics such as:

* Mean discharge
* Average forces
* Long-term head losses

This strategy must be clearly documented and justified, particularly where results are used for design or regulatory submission.

### 5.2.4 Common Misapplications

The following practices frequently lead to misleading results:

* Forcing inherently transient flows into steady-state solvers
* Using large time steps to suppress unsteadiness
* Interpreting numerical stability as physical realism

A solution that is stable, smooth, and converged is not necessarily *physically correct*. Time dependence must be retained whenever it materially affects the outcome of interest.

### 5.2.5 Engineering Documentation Expectations

For each CFD model, the following should be explicitly stated:

* Whether the simulation is steady-state or transient
* Why this choice is appropriate for the problem
* What physical time scales are relevant
* How transient results are interpreted (instantaneous vs averaged)

This justification forms a critical link between solver selection and the verification and validation practices described in Chapter 10.
