Every OpenFOAM simulation is organised using a standard directory structure.
Understanding this structure is fundamental, as all case configuration, physics definition, and numerical control are handled through files within these directories.

A typical OpenFOAM case has the following layout:
caseName/
├── 0/
├── constant/
└── system/
Each directory has a clearly defined role in the simulation.

The 0/ Directory — Initial and Boundary Conditions

The 0/ directory contains the field variables at the start of the simulation. These files define:
  -  Initial conditions within the computational domain
  -  Boundary conditions applied to each patch
For an incompressible turbulent flow case, the directory may contain:
0/
├── U
├── p
├── k
├── epsilon

Each file corresponds to a single field variable.

A typical field file includes:
  -  dimensions — ensures dimensional consistency
  -  internalField — initial value inside the domain
  -  boundaryField — boundary condition definitions

Example structure:
dimensions      [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0];

internalField   uniform (0 0 0);
boundaryField
{
    inlet
    {
        type fixedValue;
        value uniform (1 0 0);
    }
    outlet
    {
        type zeroGradient;
    }
}
OpenFOAM enforces dimensional consistency. Incorrect dimensions will result in runtime errors.

**The constant/ Directory — Physical Properties and Mesh

The constant/ directory contains data that does not change with simulation time.

Typical contents:
constant/
├── transportProperties
├── turbulenceProperties
└── polyMesh/

Physical Properties

transportProperties defines fluid properties such as kinematic viscosity.

In compressible or thermal cases, thermophysicalProperties may also be present.

Turbulence Model Selection

turbulenceProperties specifies whether the case is:
  -  Laminar
  -  RANS
  -  LES
and defines the selected turbulence model.

The polyMesh/ Directory

Located at:
constant/polyMesh/

This directory contains the computational mesh files:
points
faces
owner
neighbour
boundary

These files define the control volumes used in the finite volume method.
They are typically generated using:
  -  blockMesh
  -  snappyHexMesh
  -  External mesh conversion tools

**The system/ Directory — Numerical Configuration

The system/ directory controls how the simulation is executed and solved.

Typical contents:
system/
├── controlDict
├── fvSchemes
└── fvSolution

controlDict

Defines global run parameters:
  -  Solver application
  -  Start and end time
  -  Time step size
  -  Output frequency
Example:
application     simpleFoam;
startTime       0;
endTime         1000;
deltaT          1;
writeInterval   100;

fvSchemes

Defines discretisation schemes for:
  -  Time derivatives
  -  Gradients
  -  Divergence terms
  -  Laplacians

These selections influence numerical accuracy and stability.

fvSolution

Defines:
  -  Linear solvers
  -  Convergence tolerances
  -  Relaxation factors
  -  Algorithm control (SIMPLE, PISO, PIMPLE)

This file governs solver behaviour and convergence performance.

Time Directories

When a simulation runs, new time directories are created:
0
100
200
300
...

Each directory contains the solution fields at that time step.
The write frequency is controlled by controlDict.

Structural Overview

| Directory        | Function                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `0/`             | Initial and boundary conditions    |
| `constant/`      | Mesh and physical properties       |
| `system/`        | Numerical and solver configuration |
| Time directories | Simulation results                 |

Key Principle

An OpenFOAM case is deliberately modular:

Physics definition (0/, constant/)

Numerical definition (system/)

Execution control (controlDict)

This separation allows independent modification of mesh, physics, and numerics — a core strength of OpenFOAM.
