# Section 01.3 — Scope, Assumptions, and Limitations

Every CFD simulation is based on assumptions and simplifications.  
This manual is no exception.

Defining scope and limitations explicitly is essential for correct interpretation and responsible use.

---

## 1. Intended Scope

This manual focuses on the **engineering use of OpenFOAM** for practical CFD applications.

Primary areas of emphasis include:
- Incompressible and weakly compressible flows
- Internal and external engineering flows
- Transient simulations
- Turbulence modeling (RANS, LES, hybrid approaches)
- Free-surface and multiphase flows (VOF)
- Mesh strategy, numerical stability, and diagnostics
- Verification and validation practices

Examples and recommendations prioritize robustness and clarity over minimal runtime or academic novelty.

---

## 2. Assumed Background Knowledge

The reader is assumed to have:
- A basic understanding of fluid mechanics
- Familiarity with partial differential equations
- Introductory knowledge of numerical methods for CFD

This manual does **not** teach:
- Fundamental fluid mechanics
- Derivation of governing equations
- General numerical analysis theory

Those topics are assumed knowledge or should be learned from dedicated textbooks.

---

## 3. What This Manual Does Not Cover

This manual does not attempt to provide comprehensive guidance on:
- High-speed compressible flows
- Combustion and reacting flows
- Radiation modeling
- Complex rheology or non-Newtonian fluids
- Highly specialized solvers outside common engineering use

These topics may be referenced where relevant but are not treated in depth.

---

## 4. Version and Implementation Scope

The primary reference platform for this manual is **OpenFOAM Foundation**, with version differences noted where they materially affect behavior.

Where differences exist between distributions or versions:
- Assumptions are stated explicitly
- Behavior is described rather than assumed
- Recommendations are made conservatively

This manual does not attempt to document every version-specific detail.

---

## 5. Limits of Guidance

No manual can replace engineering judgment.

The recommendations provided here:
- Do not guarantee correct results
- Do not remove the need for verification and validation
- Do not absolve the user from understanding the modeled physics

This manual aims to **reduce common errors**, improve transparency, and support informed decision-making — not to provide automated correctness.

---

## 6. Responsibility of the User

Ultimately, the user is responsible for:
- Assessing the suitability of modeling assumptions
- Verifying numerical correctness
- Validating results against physical reality
- Documenting limitations and uncertainty

This manual is a guide, not a substitute for professional responsibility.
