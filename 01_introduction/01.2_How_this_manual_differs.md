# Section 01.2 — How This Manual Differs from Official OpenFOAM Documentation

This manual is intended to **complement**, not replace, official OpenFOAM documentation.

OpenFOAM provides extensive reference material describing solvers, libraries, and dictionary syntax. That documentation is essential, but it is primarily **descriptive**: it explains what components exist and how they are used, with limited discussion of engineering decision-making.

This manual addresses a different need.

---

## 1. Engineering Focus vs Reference Focus

Official OpenFOAM documentation focuses on:
- Solver capabilities
- Dictionary entries and syntax
- Code-level structure

This manual focuses on:
- Engineering assumptions and their implications
- Model and solver selection rationale
- Numerical stability and failure modes
- Physical consistency and credibility of results

The emphasis is not on completeness of options, but on **correct use in practice**.

---

## 2. Explanation of “Why”, Not Just “How”

Tutorials and user guides typically show *how* to run a case.  
This manual explains *why* a particular approach is appropriate and *when it is not*.

Examples include:
- Why a simulation may converge numerically but still be wrong
- Why certain boundary condition combinations are inconsistent
- Why mesh quality often dominates solution behavior
- Why turbulence model choice must precede meshing

These aspects are often learned informally through experience; this manual makes them explicit.

---

## 3. Opinionated, With Justification

This manual is intentionally **opinionated**, but not arbitrary.

Recommendations are based on:
- Physical reasoning
- Numerical analysis principles
- Common failure patterns observed in practice
- Established CFD best practices

Alternative approaches are acknowledged where appropriate, but defaults are chosen deliberately and justified.

---

## 4. Integration of Dispersed Knowledge

Much practical OpenFOAM knowledge exists in:
- Forum discussions
- Mailing lists
- Conference papers
- Personal experience

This manual consolidates that dispersed knowledge into a **structured, navigable reference**, with consistent terminology and explicit assumptions.

---

## 5. Relationship to Official Documentation

Official OpenFOAM documentation remains the authoritative source for:
- Solver definitions
- Dictionary syntax
- Implementation details

This manual assumes that documentation exists and focuses instead on **interpretation, application, and engineering judgment**.

Readers are expected to consult official documentation alongside this manual when detailed reference information is required.
