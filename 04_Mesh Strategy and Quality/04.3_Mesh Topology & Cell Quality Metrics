Purpose

Mesh topology and cell quality directly influence solution accuracy, numerical stability, and solver robustness. Poor topology can lead to non-physical results even if mesh statistics (e.g. cell count) appear acceptable. This subsection provides practical diagnostics and quality targets tailored for engineering simulations.

4.3.1 Mesh Topology Fundamentals

Topology refers to how cells are connected in the mesh. Key aspects include:

Cell shape distribution: Ideally predominantly hexahedral shapes for structured regions; tetrahedral or polyhedral cells where complexity demands.

Edge and face alignment: Cells should align with predominant flow directions where possible (e.g., boundary layers) to reduce numerical diffusion.

Neighbour connectivity: A well-connected mesh (regular neighbour counts per cell) reduces abrupt gradients in interpolation stencils.

In OpenFOAM, mesh topology is stored in polyMesh (points, faces, owner/neighbour) and is used by all solvers internally.

4.3.2 Cell Quality Metrics

Evaluate quality metrics using utilities like checkMesh before any simulation:

Non-orthogonality (max non-orthogonality): Target < 70°. Values above ~80° indicate dangerous regions that can degrade matrix conditioning.

Skewness: Lower skewness values (< 4) are generally acceptable. Severe skew impacts gradient accuracy.

Aspect ratio: For boundary layer regions, high aspect ratios may be physically necessary (thin layers), but in bulk flow aim for < 10:1 where possible.

Face area ratio / cell volume ratio: Large variations can destabilise solvers, especially in RANS/LES contexts.

Example in checkMesh output:

Max non-orthogonality: 82.5°
Max skewness: 6.7
Max aspect ratio: 29

Action: revisit mesh refinement, smoothing, or refine region control to improve metrics.

4.3.3 Practical Tips

Boundary layers: Prefer expanding prisms or hexa layers with growth ratio < 1.2–1.25 to avoid excessive numerical diffusion.

Transition regions: Introduce gradual refinement; avoid sudden cell size jumps which induce interpolation errors.

Mesh perturbations: For curved geometries, use mesh smoothing or surface refinement rather than high skewness.

4.3.4 Diagnostics Workflow

Run blockMesh / snappyHexMesh to build base mesh.

Run checkMesh and parse warnings (>70° non-orthogonality, large skew).

Visualise problematic regions in ParaView — colour by quality criteria.

Apply corrective interpolations or local refinements; rerun diagnostics.

Tip: Combining quality outputs with physics intuition (e.g., pressure gradients, expected vortical regions) improves mesh design quality for high-fidelity engineering results.

4.3.5 Case Example — Mesh Correction

For a complex bluff body:

Initial mesh shows peaks of non-orthogonality near sharp leading edges.

Solution: insert targeted surface refinement and use featureEdgeMesh to preserve geometric fidelity.

Result: non-orthogonality reduced below 65°, solver converges faster with reduced residual noise.
