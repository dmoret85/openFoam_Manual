# openFoam_Manual
OpenFOAM Engineering Manual is an engineering-focused guide that bridges the gap between official OpenFOAM documentation and real-world CFD practice. It explains why modeling, numerical, and solver choices are made, how to detect failure modes, and how to build stable, physically consistent simulations. Built for engineers students, researchers CFD
