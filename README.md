# OpenFOAM Engineering Manual

OpenFOAM Engineering Manual is an engineering-focused guide that bridges the gap between official OpenFOAM documentation and real-world CFD practice. It explains why modeling and numerical choices are made, how to detect failure modes, and how to build stable, physically consistent simulations.

## Purpose

This repository documents practical, engineering-level knowledge for using OpenFOAM as a reliable CFD tool. It focuses on reasoning, assumptions, and diagnostics rather than tutorial-style repetition.

## Scope

- Incompressible and weakly compressible flows  
- Transient simulations and numerical stability  
- Turbulence modeling (RAS, LES, hybrid)  
- Free-surface and multiphase flows  
- Mesh strategy and quality control  
- Boundary conditions and physical consistency  
- Verification, validation, and post-processing  

## What This Is Not

- Not a replacement for official OpenFOAM documentation  
- Not a collection of copy-paste tutorials  
- Not an introduction to basic fluid mechanics  

## Philosophy

Engineering-first, solver-aware, and opinionated where necessary.  
Assumptions and limitations are stated explicitly, with decisions justified using physics and numerics.

## Status

🚧 Work in progress — structure and content will evolve.
