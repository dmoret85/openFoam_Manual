# Validation — Are the Correct Equations Being Solved?

Validation assesses how well a simulation represents reality. It requires comparison against experimental data, analytical solutions, or trusted benchmarks.

A verified simulation may still be invalid if its modeling assumptions are inappropriate.

## 1. Role of Validation in Engineering CFD

Validation establishes:
- Credibility of predicted trends
- Applicability of the model to the intended use
- Limits of confidence in quantitative results

Validation is problem-specific and cannot be generalized from unrelated cases.

---

## 2. Sources of Validation Data

Common validation sources include:
- Experimental measurements
- Analytical or semi-analytical solutions
- Well-established benchmark cases
- Field measurements (with known uncertainty)

The quality of validation is limited by the quality of reference data.

## 3. What to Compare

Validation should focus on:
- Integral quantities (forces, pressure losses)
- Profiles and distributions (velocity, pressure)
- Trends rather than isolated values

Pointwise agreement is less important than consistent physical behavior.

---

## 4. Uncertainty and Tolerance

Perfect agreement is neither expected nor required.

Good practice:
- Acknowledge experimental uncertainty
- Define acceptable error margins
- Focus on engineering relevance

Validation is about confidence, not exact matches.

---

## 5. Model Applicability and Limits

Validation results apply only within the range of:
- Flow regime
- Geometry
- Boundary conditions
- Operating conditions

Extrapolation beyond validated conditions should be stated explicitly.

---

## 6. Common Validation Pitfalls

- Tuning numerical parameters to match data
- Ignoring uncertainty in reference measurements
- Validating against a single quantity only
- Treating validation as a one-time step

Validation is an ongoing process, not a checkbox.
