# Verification — Are the Equations Solved Correctly?

Verification assesses numerical correctness independent of real-world data. A verified solution satisfies the mathematical model as implemented.

Verification does not guarantee physical accuracy, but a solution that is not verified cannot be trusted.

## 1. What Verification Is (and Is Not)

Verification checks:
- Correct implementation of governing equations
- Adequate spatial and temporal resolution
- Consistent numerical behavior

Verification does not:
- Confirm physical realism
- Compensate for poor modeling assumptions

---

## 2. Mesh Independence

Mesh independence is assessed by refining the mesh in **physically relevant regions** and monitoring changes in key quantities.

Good practice:
- Refine systematically (not randomly)
- Monitor integral quantities (forces, pressure drop)
- Avoid interpreting local point values in isolation

Mesh independence does not mean identical results, but diminishing sensitivity to further refinement.

## 3. Time-Step Sensitivity

For transient simulations, time-step sensitivity must be evaluated.

Steps:
- Reduce the time step while keeping all other settings fixed
- Monitor key quantities for convergence in time
- Ensure CFL limits are respected throughout the domain

A time-accurate solution must be insensitive to reasonable reductions in time step.

## 4. Residuals and Numerical Convergence

Residuals indicate how well the discretized equations are satisfied.

Key points:
- Low residuals do not guarantee correctness
- Stable residuals are necessary but not sufficient
- Residual trends should be interpreted alongside physical monitors

Residual convergence must be consistent with stable physical quantities.

## 5. Conservation Checks

Verification should include explicit checks of:
- Mass conservation
- Momentum balance
- Energy balance (if applicable)

Small local violations may exist, but global imbalances should be negligible relative to engineering tolerances.

---

## 6. Common Verification Pitfalls

- Declaring convergence based on residuals alone
- Refining mesh without physical rationale
- Ignoring time-step sensitivity
- Over-interpreting noisy transient behavior

Verification requires deliberate numerical testing, not visual inspection alone.
