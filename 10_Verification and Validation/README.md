# Chapter 10 — Verification and Validation

Verification and validation are essential steps in establishing confidence in CFD results.

- **Verification** addresses whether the equations are solved correctly.
- **Validation** addresses whether the correct equations are being solved.

This chapter provides practical, engineering-oriented guidance for verifying and validating OpenFOAM simulations, with emphasis on transparency, consistency, and decision-making.
