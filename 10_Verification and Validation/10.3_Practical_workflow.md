# Practical Verification and Validation Workflow

This section provides a practical sequence for applying verification and validation in engineering CFD projects.

---

## Step 1 — Define quantities of interest

Identify:
- Primary engineering outputs
- Secondary diagnostic quantities

Avoid validating quantities that are not used in decisions.

---

## Step 2 — Perform verification first

Before comparing to data:
- Check mesh sensitivity
- Check time-step sensitivity
- Confirm numerical stability

Do not adjust physics to fix numerical issues.

---

## Step 3 — Compare against reference data

Use:
- Consistent operating conditions
- Comparable quantities
- Transparent metrics

Document discrepancies and possible causes.

---

## Step 4 — Assess robustness

Test sensitivity to:
- Turbulence model choice
- Boundary condition variations
- Reasonable numerical changes

Robust results inspire confidence.

---

## Step 5 — Document assumptions and limits

State clearly:
- What was verified
- What was validated
- Where confidence is high
- Where uncertainty remains

A transparent model is more valuable than an unqualified one.
